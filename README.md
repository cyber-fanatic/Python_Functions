# Python_Functions
- In this repository we will discuss the functions in python.
- A **function** is a **named** block of **reusable code** that performs a **specific task**. It allows you to organize your code into manageable chunks, making it **easier** to **read**, **understand**, and **maintain**.
## Example:
```python3
def hello(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Calling the function
hello("Sherry")
# hello("Name...")

```
- **def** is the **keyword** used to define a function.
- **hello** is the name of the function.
- **()** is used to enclose the **parameters** of the function (which are **name** in this case).
- **print(f"Hello, {name}!")** is the code block inside the function that prints **"Hello, name"**.
- **Calling** the function **hello()** executes the code inside the function and **prints "Hello,Sherry"**.
# Diffrence between print() and return ():
The **print()** and **return()** both are the same functons but common **diffrence** is that 
you **can't save the output of print functon** in some other  veriable while using **return() function
you will be able to store the output of the function** in other veriables.
